## Getting started

> Run these commands in the root directory of this project, not in this one.

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then build the packages:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
cd docs && pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 with your browser to see the result.

You can now start editing! Pages auto-update as you edit their files.
